# About

I'm a former academic who made the move into data science. I worked with genomic data for years and now work in insurance. I'm mainly making this website for myself, to push myself to try out new things and write about them so I can re-use code pieces in the future. I'm hoping to tidy up my code and try out some more complex things. 

I mostly work with R at work, and have used it for about 10 years. I learned python when I was bored at work about 5 years ago and use it sporadically. 

The only thing about academia I miss is teaching. I really enjoyed teaching others how to code and being able to help people. 

I'm an expat living in the UK. I enjoy yoga and walks with my dog.
