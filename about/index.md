# About

I'm an ex-academic who moved into data science. I'm mainly making this website for myself, to push myself to try out new things and write about them so I remember them. Its also so I can re-use/steal my own code a bit easier. 

The only thing about academia I miss is teaching. I really enjoyed running teaching others how to code and being able to help people. 

I am an American currently living in the UK. I enjoy yoga and walks with my dog.
