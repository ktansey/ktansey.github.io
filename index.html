	<h1>Hello and welcome to a place to steal code</h1>
	<p>I work as a data scientist. This is the first time I've created a webpage, and plan to blog about playing around with data. 
		I'm doing this mostly for me, to have a place to write out useful bits about code so I remember them for later. 
		It will hopefully make reusing code easier.</p>
