	<h1>Hello and welcome to a place to steal code</h1>
	<p>I work as a data scientist. This is the first time I've created a webpage, and plan to write some posts about playing around with data and things that I learn/find useful. This is probably mostly for me, to try things out and create a place to remember those things for me to use again/steal from myself later.</p>
